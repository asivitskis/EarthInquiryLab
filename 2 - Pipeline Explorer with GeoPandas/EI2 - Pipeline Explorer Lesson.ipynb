    "- Practice ethical mapping principles when working with data"

    "\n",
    "Across the North American continent, petroleum pipelines often cross, border, or pass near the lands of Indigenous nations. These routes are not random - they grow out of long histories of settlement, extraction and what scholars call \"invasive infrastructure.\" As anthropologis Anne Spince (2018) explains, pipelines are note just pieces of equipment. They are part of a continuing system that can reshape Indigenous homelands and enable the movement of resources away from places they originate. These actions take the form of carrying oil and gas across lands that hold deep cultural, ecological, and economic significance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Legal scholar Guillermo J. Garcia Sanchez (2020) also describes how these projects often bring competing ideas into conflict: the alotted rights of coprorations to extract and transport resources versus the rights of Indigenous communities to give or withold free, prior, and informed consent. In many cases, governments prioritize economic interests over community well-being. This occurs even when international law recognizinges Indigenous rights to meaningful participation in decisions that affect their land.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this history, mapping pipeline routes alongside Tribal land boundaries is a way of asking critical questions. Importantly, this notebook will help us to ask:\n",
    " - **Where are pipelines located in relation to Tribal Lands?**\n",
    " - Where do they intersect, overlap, or come close?\n",
    " - What patterns or questions emerge when we visualize these relationships?  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address this geo-inquiry question, we’ll use geospatial tools to explore these questions while keeping ethics at the center. We will follow basic principles of Tribal data sovereignty by: using only publically released datasets; not making claims about ownership, authority, or cultural interpretation; encouraging learners to understand the limits of non-tribal data sources. \n",
